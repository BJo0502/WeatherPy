### Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Overview:

The purpose of this project is to modify the PlanMyTrip vacation planning app. This app allows users to input their ideal temperature range and PlanMyTrip identifies the perfect cities as well as lodging recommendations to help users narrow down their search results. Once our vacationers have selected their dream destinations, PlanMyTrip allows them to customize their travel itinerary through the use of Google Map’s Direction API.

This app utilizes the following API’s:
Google Maps Places,
Google Maps Directions,
Open Weather Map
